MediaDecoder for Unity - v1.0.3

Quick start:
0.	Download the FFmpeg 64 bits from http://dl4.htc.com/vive/ViveHomeSDK/FFmpeg-64bits.zip
1.	Put the following dlls to project folder(the same directory with Assets or beside *.exe)
	- avcodec-57.dll
	- avformat-57.dll
	- avutil-55.dll
	- swresample-2.dll
	- libeay32.dll
2.	Create a model with MeshRenderer(ex.Quad) and attach MediaDecoder.cs as component.
3.	Set MeshRenderer’s Material to YUV2RGBA and make sure the shader to be YUV2RGBA.(YUV2RGBA_linear is for linear color space)
4.	Fill in video path(ex. D:\_Video\sample.mp4) and enable Play On Awake.
5.	Click play, now you should be able to see the video playing on the model.

Requirements:
- The plugin currently only supports Windows / DX11.

API lists:
- bool isVideoEnabled:
	(Read only) Video is enabled or not. This value is available after initialization.

- bool isAudioEnabled
	(Read only) Audio is enabled or not. This value is available after initialization.

- float videoTotalTime
	(Read only) Video duration. This value is available after initialization.

- float audioTotalTime
	(Read only) Audio duration. This value is available after initialization.

- void initDecoder(string path):
	Start a asynchronized initialization coroutine. onInitComplete event would be invoked when initialization was done.

- void startDecoding():
	Start native decoding. It only works for initialized state.

- void replay():
	Replay the video.
	
- void stopDecoding():
	Stop native decoding process. It would be called at OnApplicationQuit and OnDestroy.

- void setSeekTime(float seekTime):
	Seek video to given time. Seek to time zero if seekTime over video duration.
	
- bool isSeeking():
	Return true if decoder is processing seek.
	
- void setStepForward(float sec):
	Seek based on current time. It is equivalent to setSeekTime(currentTime + sec).
	
- void setStepBackward(float sec):
	Seek based on current time. It is equivalent to setSeekTime(currentTime - sec).
	
- void getVideoResolution(ref int width, ref int height):
	Get video resolution. It is valid after initialization.
	
- float getVideoCurrentTime():
	Get video current time(seconds).
	
- DecoderState getDecoderState():
	Get decoder state. The states are defined in MediaDecoder.DecoderState.
	
- void setPause():
	Pause the video playing. It is available after initialization.
	
- void setResume():
	Resume from pause. It is available only for pause state.
	
- void setVolume(float vol):
	Set the video volume(0.0 ~ 1.0). Default value is 1.0.
	
- float getVolume():
	Get the video volume.
	
- void mute():
	Mute video. It is equivalent to setVolume(0.0f).
	
- void unmute():
	Unmute video. It is equivalent to setVolume(origianlVolume).
	
- static void getMetaData(string filePath, out string[] key, out string[] value):
	Get all meta data key-value pairs.
	
Tools and sample implement:
- UVSphere.cs:
	Generate custom resolution UV-Sphere. It is useful for 360 video player.

- FileSeeker.cs:
	Used to get file path sequentially from a folder.
	
- StereoHandler.cs:
	A tool to set texture coordinates for stereo case.

- StereoProperty.cs:
	A data class to describe stereo state.
	
- VideoSourceController.cs:
	Sample implement to load video one by one from a folder.
	
- StereoVideoSourceController.cs:
	Stereo version of VideoSourceController.
	
- ImageSourceController.cs:
	Sample implement to load image one by one from a folder.
	
- StereoImageSourceController.cs:
	Stereo version of ImageSourceController.

Scenes:
- SampleScene.unity:
	A sample to play video on a quad by following the quick start.

- Demo:
	Demo some use cases which include video, stereo video, image, stereo image and 360 video.
	Please follow the steps below to make it work properly:
	1. Add two layers named LeftEye and RightEye.
	2. Found the objects named begining with "Stereo", set it's children's layer to LeftEye and RightEye.
	3. Set the Camera (left eye)'s Target Eye to Left, Culling Mask to uncheck RightEye.
	4. Set the Camera (right eye)'s Target Eye to Right, Culling Mask to uncheck LeftEye.
	5. Modify the directory of each demo to your own path and click play.

Changes for v1.0.3:
- Add a shader for linear color space.
- Modify the sample scene for Unity 5.4.
Changes for v1.0.2:
- Support streaming through https.
